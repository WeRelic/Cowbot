'''

    This file is for the second-to-the-bottom layer of planning, just above Mechanics.py.
    Here we deal with things that are still universally referred to as "mechanics" by human
    players, but require more complicated inputs consisting of multiple sequential inputs.
    These will involve conditionals so that the same line can call the entire maneuver, e.g.,
    for a fast diagonal flip, the code here should check on which frames to jump, turn, 
    flip, and boost.

    
    Conventions:

    This file will use goal_state for where we want the car to end up.  Mechanics.py will use
    target_state.  This keeps naming clear between immediate and slightly-less-immediate plans.

    Coordinates in this file are relative to the car, until fed into a Mechanics.py class.

    Classes in this file should never use game_info, only CarState objects for our car,
    where our car was previously, and where we want our car to go.  Other game objects
    should only be called at higher levels, where we're planning what to do.  For example, hitting
    the ball should be higher up, then get a ball prediction, decide where the car needs to end up,
    then feed that decision into a class here.
