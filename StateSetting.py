    This will set the game state as specified.  Most of the code is translating between different state objects.
    game_info is passed solely for the indices of each car, because I have no way of knowing that a priori.
    Seeing as it's unlikely I'll want to mess with boost pads anytime soon, I'm skipping that for now.
    game_info is a GameState object (from CowBot code). 
    ball_state is a BallState object (from CowBot code).
    current_state is a CarState object (from CowBot code).
    teammates_state is a list of CarState objects (from CowBot code).
    opponents_state is a list of CarState objects (from CowBot code).
    boosts_state is currently skipped and should always be None.
    game_info_state is also currently skipped and should be None.
