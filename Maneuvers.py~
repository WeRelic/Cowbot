   This file is for the second-to-the-bottom layer of planning, just above Mechanics.py.
   Here we deal with things that are still universally referred to as "mechanics" by human
   players, but require more complicated inputs consisting of multiple sequential inputs.
   These will involve conditionals so that the same line can call the entire maneuver, e.g.,
   for a fast diagonal flip, the code here should check when to jump, turn, flip, and boost.
